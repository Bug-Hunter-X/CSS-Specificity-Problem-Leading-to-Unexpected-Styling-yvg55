To fix the specificity issue, we can adjust the selector order or modify the selectors themselves to ensure the intended styles are applied.  In this scenario, we increased the specificity of the more important selector to ensure it takes precedence.  Alternatively, using the !important flag can resolve the issue, but it's generally best to avoid that unless absolutely necessary to maintain maintainability.
